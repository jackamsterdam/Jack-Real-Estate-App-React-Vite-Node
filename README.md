SCSS Mixins (with @include) use the @content directive inside mixin for dynamic content:

The @content directive in SCSS makes code more modular and flexible by allowing dynamic content insertion within mixins. Here's how it enhances modularity:

Reusable Mixins: With @content, you can create mixins that encapsulate common styles but allow customization of specific properties each time they're used. This promotes code reuse and keeps your styles DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
Flexibility: By allowing dynamic content insertion, mixins become more flexible. You can customize the behavior of mixins by passing different content each time they're included using @include.
Separation of Concerns: Mixins with @content help maintain a clear separation of concerns. Mixins focus on defining reusable styles, while the content provided via @content focuses on specific variations or additions to those styles.
Modularity: With @content, mixins become more modular. They can be used in various contexts with different content, enabling a more modular architecture in your stylesheet.
Easier Maintenance: By abstracting common styles into mixins and using @content to inject dynamic content, your code becomes easier to maintain. Changes to common styles can be made in one place (the mixin definition), and those changes will be reflected wherever the mixin is used.
